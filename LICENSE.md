- The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms for non-commercial use.

## 2. Attribution

You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

## 3. ShareAlike

If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.

## 4. Commercial Use and Explicit Permission

Commercial use of this material requires the explicit permission of CharaChorder. You must contact CharaChorder to obtain written consent for each intended commercial use.

## 5. Revocation of Commercial License

CharaChorder reserves the right to revoke permission for commercial use at any time and at their sole discretion. If commercial use permission is revoked, any commercial use of the material must cease immediately upon notification from CharaChorder.

## How This License Differs from CC BY-SA

This license explicitly allows CharaChorder to revoke commercial rights. Users need to obtain consent to use files in any commercial setting, which isn’t a requirement under traditional CC BY-SA.

## Non-Commercial Use Indefinitely Permitted
Non-commercial users can freely use and share the files without needing ongoing permission.
