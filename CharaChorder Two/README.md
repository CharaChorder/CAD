# CharaChorder Two

## Caps

Unlike the CharaChorder One, the caps on the CharaChorder Two are made from 3D-printed plastic, which generally wonâ€™t damage the switch stems when removed. However, care should still be taken to avoid putting stress on the switch stems. To minimize the risk of damage, always pull the caps straight off in a controlled, careful manner. When replacing the caps back on, make sure you align the square hole of the cap with the square stem; otherwise, you may damage the switch stem.

When removing caps, you might occasionally knock off the rubber X-ring installed from the factory. If this happens, take off the cap and then use needle-nose pliers or a similar tool to gently stretch the ring and place it back onto the cap and then reinstall the cap. In the [Rubber Ring Mounting Tools](Rubber%20Ring%20Mounting%20Tools/README.md) folder, we've provided the CAD files for the tools used on the factory floor to assemble these components. However, for just one or two X-rings, these tools are generally unnecessary.

## Full CAD Reference

This folder contains a complete CAD representation of the CharaChorder Two assembly. It includes all critical components you may need for measurements or as a reference. Keep in mind that these are design files, so actual dimensions may vary slightly. Be sure to make adjustments to your designs as needed.

Note: the step assembly file includes "stretched x-rings" already into the model (although they are separate bodies that you can turn off).
